 * <p>
 * The {@link IWiQueryPlugin} interface defines all WiQuery plugins, e.g. all
 * components/behaviors outputting jQuery statements to function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * WiQuery plugins are components or behaviors generating JavaScript jQuery code. WiQuery
 * manages the component or behavior, outputs the JavaScript needed to function and
 * imports all JavaScript resources needed by the component or behavior.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The contribute method is not needed since wicket 1.5 as Component and or Behaviors
 * themselves are contributers. Simply override
 * {@link Component#renderHead(IHeaderResponse)} or
 * {@link Behavior#renderHead(Component, IHeaderResponse)}).
 * </p>
